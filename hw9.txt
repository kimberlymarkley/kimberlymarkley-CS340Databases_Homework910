Part 1: Entity-Relationship Diagram

** Planet **
Multiple Planets orbit one Star; some are orbited by one or more Moons.
All Planets are monitored by many Artificial Satellites.

** Star **
The Sol System has just one Star, but this model was built for scalibility
and could be used to model other solar systems with more than one Star.
It is also monitored by multiple Artificial Satellites.

** Asteroid **
Many Asteroids orbit the solar system's Star, and can collide with Planets and Moons.
Not all Asteroids are monitored by Artificial Satellites.

** Moon **
All moons orbit Planets (but all Planets do not have moons). 

** Alien Life **
Not much is known about Alien Life, since it hides from all Artificial Satellites. 
Most of the data for Alien Life is hearsay, and it must be a weak entity. 

** Comet **
Not all Comets are monitored by Artificial Satellites, nor do all Comets orbit the sun,
since it is possible that some enter our solar system and from afar and just pass through.
Comets are noticeable as they approach the Star, and some will acquire names. 



Grading Considerations
	1	If there are extra constraints that cannot be captured by the E/R diagram, list them in a supplementary text file.

	2	List any assumptions you make in the process.

	3	Your E/R diagram should contain at least six (or more) entities; otherwise, it is likely not of sufficient complexity for a CS 340 project.

	4	Make sure your diagram captures a significant number of relationships, and all those required to accomplish your project goals.

	5	For each entity set and relationship, write a short description of what it represents or models in plain English.
	◦	one or two sentences per entity set and relationship are enough
	◦	these descriptions are primarily to help me understand what you are modeling and ensure that you are modeling it correctly.



Deliverables:
1. EER PDF
2. Relational Schema PDF
3. SQL document with Create Table commands and comments, Insert Into with Sample data (cite real life sources), then queries for each table(Limit 5), 5 Sample transactions
4. a txt document with sample queries and result set

Include public git hub

Talk about reasoning behind  
- weak entity for Alien Life 
- 1 to M star for scalibility as universe is explored (also explain participation)
- Monitors Table just full of ids? used to illustrate and quantify the structural constraint that all entities are monitored (page 88-92)

Part 4: Sample Data
These queries are also in hw9.sql and /table-data/index.php
SELECT * FROM ARTIFICIAL_SATELLITE ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM SATELLITE_TASK ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM ALIEN_LIFE ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM STAR ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM MOON ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM ASTEROID ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM COMET ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM PLANET ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM MOON_ORBIT ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;

Part 5: Sample Transactions
1. Asteroids and Comets that have a mass greater than Mercury and less than Earth.
    SELECT Name, Mass 
    FROM (SELECT Name, Mass FROM Asteroid UNION SELCT Name, Mass FROM Comet) 
    WHERE Mass BETWEEN (SELECT Mass FROM Planet WHERE Name='Mercury') AND (SELECT Mass FROM Planet WHERE Name='Earth') 
    ORDER BY Mass ASC 
    LIMIT 5;
2. Solar System names that contain the letter combination 'ol'.
    SELECT Name 
    FROM (
        SELECT Name 
        FROM Artificial_satellite 
            UNION SELECT Name FROM Alien_life 
            UNION SELECT Name FROM STAR
            UNION SELECT Name FROM Planet
            UNION SELECT Name FROM Moon 
            UNION SELECT Name FROM asteroid 
            UNION SELECT Name FROM comet) 
    WHERE Name LIKE '%ol%' 
    ORDER BY Name ASC
    LIMIT 5;
3. Planets and their corresponding Moons.
    SELECT Planet.Name, Moon.Name 
    FROM Moon, Planet 
    WHERE Planet.Pid=Moon.Pid 
    ORDER BY Planet.Name ASC
    LIMIT 5;
4. The smallest and largest gravities of all Planets and Moons.
    SELECT MIN(mn), MAX(mx)
    FROM (
        SELECT MAX(Gravity) as mx, MIN(Gravity) as mn
        FROM Planet
            UNION SELECT MAX(Gravity) as mx, MIN(Gravity) as mn
            FROM Moon) AS Subquery;
5. The name and task of the satellite from Nigeria.
    SELECT Artificial_satellite.Name, Satellite_task.Task 
    FROM Artificial_satellite, Satellite_task
    WHERE Artificial_satellite.Satid=Satellite_task.Satid
    AND Artificial_satellite.Country_origin='Nigeria';
