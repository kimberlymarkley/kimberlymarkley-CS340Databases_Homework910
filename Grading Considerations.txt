Grading Considerations
	1	If there are extra constraints that cannot be captured by the E/R diagram, list them in a supplementary text file.

	2	List any assumptions you make in the process.

	3	Your E/R diagram should contain at least six (or more) entities; otherwise, it is likely not of sufficient complexity for a CS 340 project.

	4	Make sure your diagram captures a significant number of relationships, and all those required to accomplish your project goals.

	5	For each entity set and relationship, write a short description of what it represents or models in plain English.
	◦	one or two sentences per entity set and relationship are enough
	◦	these descriptions are primarily to help me understand what you are modeling and ensure that you are modeling it correctly.

Talk about reasoning behind  
- weak entity for Alien Life 
- 1 to M star for scalibility as universe is explored (also explain participation)
- Monitors Table just full of ids? used to illustrate and quantify the structural constraint that all entities are monitored (page 88-92)
